# MyFavMoviesAPI
A simple movie API catalog project that allows the user to create, edit, list, and see details for each movie.

#### How do you intend to approach this project?
> First create the front-end, making tests with fake return of API and, after that, make the back-end based on this tests.

#### What technologies have you decided to use foreach part?
> The front-end will be created using `React.js` and the back-end using `Node.js`.

#### Do you find this to be particularly challenging in any of its requirements?
> It would be simpler and more "motivational" to focus only in the front-end or in the back-end instead of both. But in general it makes sense to do them, it's just a little more complex ðŸ˜….

#### If you had a lot of timeto do this, what would you do differently?
> Probably would make a more complex App, with more functionalities and some interations with the users, allowing the users to leave comments in the movie for example.
